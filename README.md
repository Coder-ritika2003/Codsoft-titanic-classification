# Titanic-Classifications
This Classification is predict on how many passenger survival ...

 In that data science classification we predict how many of people survive in that accident in this model we need a data set which we get from kaggle ..
 Data set link --> https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data?select=train.csv
   in this total titanic dataset we take only train.csv file in that file we working 

   At first we load our libraries on our model next we load our dataset in this model then plot our model using this needed columns and next we drop out not needed columns then perfrom logistics regrettion after that we test the model and fit the model
   and counting prediction and perfrom prediction also be perfrom model report that is more important in this model ...

   Any issue or change is needed in this model please infrom me via my portfolio and it will be help me to improve my model and classification model or accuraccy of this model...
